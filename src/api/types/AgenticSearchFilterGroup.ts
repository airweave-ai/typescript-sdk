 * A group of filter conditions combined with AND.
 *
 * Multiple filter groups are combined with OR, allowing expressions like:
 * (A AND B) OR (C AND D)
 *
 * Examples:
 *     Single group (AND):
 *         {"conditions": [
 *             {"field": "airweave_system_metadata.source_name",
 *              "operator": "equals", "value": "slack"},
 *             {"field": "airweave_system_metadata.entity_type",
 *              "operator": "equals", "value": "SlackMessageEntity"}
 *         ]}
 *
 *     Multiple groups (OR between groups, AND within):
 *         [
 *             {"conditions": [{"field": "name", "operator": "equals",
 *                              "value": "doc1"}]},
 *             {"conditions": [{"field": "name", "operator": "equals",
 *                              "value": "doc2"}]}
 *         ]
 *
 *     Breadcrumb filtering:
 *         {"conditions": [
 *             {"field": "breadcrumbs.name", "operator": "contains",
 *              "value": "Engineering"}
